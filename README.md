#Food Truck Project



## Details
The Food Truck Application allows the user to enter up to five food trucks by name, cuisine type and rating. The input is 
received and a truck id number is automatically assigned to each truck entered. Once all trucks are entered a menu populates
and allows the user to choose whether they want to see all trucks they have entered, an average of rating for all trucks or
the truck with the highest rating. The user can continue to choose any of these options until they choose the menu option of 
'quit'.

## What I Learned
This was an extremely useful exercise for me and aided in visualizing how to populate an array with objects and furthermore
be able to access the state info from each object using gets/sets. I also learned that as the projects begin to have more
moving parts, it is beneficial to break it down into individual methods. Making sure the methods were behaving accordingly
helped me visualize the data as it moved through the flow of the program.
